# Godot Materials Tests
 Testing material settings in Godot 3.4
 
 Creates a material with a base layer with customisable colour and texture, and a next pass layer with customisable colour and texture.
 Put together to learn how to create a material with an overlay. I'm sure it can be improved, and add a save/load function, but that was not the aim of this project, so has not been implemented yet.
 
 The change scene code is from the Godot Docs, and the Third Person Controller is from the Godot AssetLib, with the code modified to adjust the controls.
